# algorand-games-platform
Project for International School on Algorand Smart Contracts.

# Goal of the Project

This project aims to bring a gaming / gambling platform to the blockchain in order to make it decentralized. Players will be able to bet platform tokens to play against other players in 1 vs 1 matches. The first available game will be Morra. The tokens of the platform will also have the usefulness of acting as loyalty points to increase game winnings or receive game badges.

Roadmap:

  1. Implement the Morra game (First goal)
  2. Build the decentralized platform
  3. Develop a loyalty system based on the platform's tokens
  4. Add more games ()

# State of the Art

The most important time implementation is this [https://developer.algorand.org/solutions/morra-game-using-reach/](https://developer.algorand.org/solutions/morra-game-using-reach/) in Reach. We will develop it using Beaker to observe the differences.
